    <h3><i>Microbot (Learning to Crawl) -- Assignment 3</i></h3>

      <i>Artist Statement</i>
      <br>
      <br>My microbot reminds of insects. I wanted to make my microbot look like an insect sitting on a branch through this project. When I recorded the video, my intention seemed to have been successful. I fixed two small motors with bars and installed them on top of them when the photocell absorbs light, it makes it possible to vibrate. My analog port is installed on the tail of an insect I wanted to make it look like an insect's butt.

      <i>Challenges and Success</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      When I think about my biggest challenge while working on the microbot project, I think soldering was my biggest challenge. I've repeated through a lot of trials and errors whether soldering works well or not. Unlike previous projects, this project used a lot of electrical circuits and had to solder them well. I made a mistake in soldering the raspberry pico board, so I had to solder the pico board again. These wires soldering processes made it the hardest for me, and even though I connected the electrical circuit well, my microbot didn't work if I did the soldering wrong.
      <br>the successful part is understanding the use of the Raspberry Pico as a whole and the connection and interaction of each circuit. I think understanding the Raspberry Pico and Arduino coding programs while learning these processes is the biggest successful part of what I thinking.

      <p>The sound of the motor was small, so I took a close-up shot as much as possible.

<p>This microbot giant insect is an insect that reacts when it receives light from any kind of light. This robot does not harm people his led eyes just react and tremble in response to the little light. This insect considers light to be its main food and is very sensitive to light.
