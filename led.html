    <h3><i>Assignment 2 -- Whats in the box?</i></h3>

      <i>Artist Statement</i>
      <br>
      <br>The object I made reminds of a fjord. When we look at the fjords, there is a river that flows under the mountain range. I wanted to use LEDs to make the river reflect sunlight and look shiny. I made a mountain range shape using a recyclable
      snack box. And I built a platform to put LEDs on using other recyclable boxes in the bottom, the white paper was added to reflect the light well the between two boxes.
      The button power switch has a hole in the side of the box below and has been pulled aside. If this button is inside, you can see fjord more focused, but it's hard to operate the button, so I had to make it like this.

      <br>
      <i>Challenges and Success</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      The biggest challenge was that all of these processes were first for me. For example, how circuits work, parallelism and series, and the most difficult thing was to understand the breadboard.
      The part that was successful was somehow understanding and implementing the whole process. I made a lot of mistakes while soldering and I had to solder my breadboard again several times, but it was more like a success because it provided me
      with a good experience.

      <p>It seems like the LED is not lighting up. I think the 9v battery is discharged</p>
